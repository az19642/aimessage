# CSC207 Project: AiMessage
**Problem Domain**: Messaging System

### Specification
This project is focused on modernizing functionalities of the typical
messaging system (e.g., iMessage). We aim to integrate artificial
intelligence features powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 to provide an intelligent,
responsive, and feature-rich messaging experience.

Our platform not only empowers users with the ability to summarize
conversations and generate appropriate replies using AI,
but also enhances security for all users by enabling them to generate
secure passwords for their accounts with the help of AI.
